# Consistent Data-Driven Subgrid-Scale (SGS) Modeling for LES

Short blurb: Developed SGS stress models via **sparse regression + neural network residual correction** to improve LES accuracy and satisfy consistency requirements.

## Notes
- Addresses numerical-error consistency.
- Benchmarked on canonical turbulent flows.
