## About
Iâ€™m a Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical Engineering at Caltech (M.S. 2024), advised by Prof. H. Jane Bae. My research focuses on **data-driven flow control and sensing for airfoils in gusty conditions**, optimal sensor placement, and **consistent data-driven subgrid-scale (SGS) modeling** for LES. Previously at UIUC I worked on rheology ML and elastocapillary morphing systems.
