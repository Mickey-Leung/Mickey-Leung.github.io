# RL Lift Control on an Airfoil in Gusts

## Overview
Over the past decade, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted substantial research interest for their unparalleled potential in diverse applications, including aerial photography and time-sensitive package delivery. Many of these applications demand stable flight, a challenging feat in the face of atmospheric turbulence, which causes unpredictable disturbances and significant aerodynamic force fluctuations. Urban structures and complex terrains further exacerbate these challenges, posing serious safety risks for UAVs, particularly due to their small size. To address these issues, robust control strategies are essential. A primary objective is mitigating lift fluctuations to ensure stability, a complex task given the non-linear, chaotic nature of turbulent gusts. This project proposes using reinforcement learning (RL), a model-free machine learning technique, to develop an effective flow control strategy for UAVs in turbulent environments using limited number of onboard pressure sensors. RL is particularly suited for controlling non-linear systems without prior knowledge of system dynamics, making it a promising approach for handling turbulence-induced challenges. It employs high-fidelity turbulent flow simulation, coupled with an RL algorithm trained to optimally adjust jet actuators on the airfoil surface in response to gusty flows, aiming to minimize lift fluctuations in unsteady, turbulent conditions. This project will be one of the first attempts to incorporate RL into the control of the airfoil aerodynamics in the high-Reynolds-number, gusty environments. The findings of this study are expected to significantly advance gust mitigation systems for UAVs, enhancing their operational capabilities in extreme conditions and broadening their application scope.
