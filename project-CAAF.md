# Correlation-Aware Attribution Framework (CAAF)

Short blurb: A machine-learning attribution framework to **optimize sensor placement** for quantity prediction across fluid dynamics and other physical systems.

## Highlights
- Handles correlated features; produces robust sensor layouts.
- Validated on airfoil lift prediction under gusts.
