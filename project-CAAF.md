# Correlation-Aware Attribution Framework (CAAF)

## Overview
The **Correlation-Aware Attribution Framework (CAAF)** is a machine-learning-based feature attribution method designed to identify **optimal sensor placements** (OSP) for efficient and robust inference in complex physical systems.  
It extends traditional feature attribution by incorporating a **correlation-aware clustering** step to mitigate redundancy and ensure information diversity among candidate sensors.

CAAF introduces a universal, data-driven approach for sensor optimization across a range of nonlinear, multi-scale dynamical systems, from structural health monitoring to turbulent flow sensing.

---

## Motivation
Feature attribution assigns importance scores to model inputs, revealing which measurements most strongly influence a prediction.  
However, when input data are highly correlated, as is common in real-world physical systems, naïve attribution tends to over-select redundant sensors clustered in the same region.  
CAAF addresses this by first clustering correlated candidates and then performing attribution on cluster centers, ensuring each selected sensor contributes distinct information.

## Application: Airfoil Lift Prediction under Gusts
In gusty aerodynamic environments, accurate sensing of flow disturbances is essential for active control and gust mitigation.  
We applied CAAF to determine **optimal surface pressure sensor locations** on a NACA 0012 airfoil subjected to gusts generated by a cylinder placed upstream.

- **Result:**  
  This configuration achieved consistently lower lift prediction errors than conventional methods such as Pivoted QR, Bayesian experimental design, and uniform sensor spacing.

The figure above visualizes the mean streamwise velocity field, overlaid with the 10 CAAF-selected sensor locations (green × marks). The distribution reflects physically interpretable sensing strategies that align with dominant flow structures.

## Key Takeaways
- **Correlation-aware** preprocessing reduces redundancy and improves interpretability.  
- **Model-agnostic:** works with any data-driven surrogate model.  
- **Validated** on multiple real-world systems — airfoil lift prediction, structural health monitoring, and wall-turbulence sensing.
